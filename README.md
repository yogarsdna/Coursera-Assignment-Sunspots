# Coursera Assignment - Sunspots

This is one of the Coursera assignments provided in the Sequences, Time Series, and Prediction course in the week 4 section where it discusses Real-world time series data. This assignment is about building models from a dataset of daily minimum temperatures in the city of Melbourne, Australia measured from 1981 to 1990. In the dataset, we will parse the CSV, create a time series and build a prediction model from it, and our model should have an MAE of less than 2.
